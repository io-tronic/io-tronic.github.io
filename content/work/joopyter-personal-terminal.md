### Datadex Cyberdeck Design Contest
###### *Design and build an alternative form-factor personal computing device for data retrieval*
---

The Joopyter Personal Terminal integrates a thermal printer, display, and Raspberry Pi zero into a foldable frame.
Bringing a thermal printer into the loop gives you immediate feedback on what your creations look like in the world. It's a diegetic experience of making: bringing physical reality and the on-screen world a step closer.

### Tactility
Much of my work is inspired by the tactile experience; I want to elevate touch to the same level as sight in my work. Tapping away on sleek rectangles cannot build the same muscle memory as swiping

This is a goal I'm yet to reach, but the Joopyter is a step in that direction. It's the third such alternative form-factor portable computer that I've designed and built.
