Much of my work is inspired by tactility; I like to enable a process of making where touch is elevated to the same level as sight in the process of HMI. This is a goal I'm yet to reach, but the Joopyter is a step in that direction. It's the third such alternative form-factor portable computer that I've designed and built.

The Joopyter Personal Terminal integrates a thermal printer, display, and Raspberry Pi zero into a foldable frame.
Bringing a thermal printer into the loop gives you immediate feedback on what your creations look like in the world. It's a diegetic experience of making: bringing physical reality and the on-screen world just a step closer.
